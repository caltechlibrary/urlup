# Credentials/keyring functions
# .............................................................................
# Explanation about the weird way this is done: the Python keyring module
# only offers a single function for setting a value; ostensibly, this is
# intended to store a password associated with an identifier (a user name),
# and this identifier is expected to be obtained some other way, such as by
# using the current user's computer login name.  This poses 2 problems for us:
#
#  1. The user may want to use a different user name for the remote service,
#  so we can't assume the user's computer login name is the same.  We also
#  don't want to ask for the remote user name every time we need the
#  information, because that can end up presenting a dialog to the user every
#  time, which quickly becomes unbearably annoying.  This means we can't use
#  a user-generated identifer to access the keyring value -- we have to
#  invent a value, and then store the user's name for the remote service as
#  part of the value we store.  (Here, we use the fake user name "credentials" to
#  access the value stored in the user's keyring for a given service.)
#
#  2. We need to store several pieces of information, not just a password,
#  but the Python keyring module interface (and presumably most system
#  keychains) does not allow anything but a string value.  The hackacious
#  solution taken here is to concatenate several values into a single string
#  used as the actual value stored.  The individual values are separated by a
#  character that is unlikely to be part of any user-typed value.

def get_credentials(service, user=None):
    '''Looks up the user's credentials for the given 'service' using the
    keyring/keychain facility on this computer.  If 'user' is None, this uses
    the fake user named "credentials".  The latter makes it possible to access a
    service with a different user login name than the user's current login
    name without having to ask the user for the alternative name every time.
